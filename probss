1. My git could not push to remote :
    - it was using default credentials stored in the local credentials manager of windows
    - i changed it: by reading "https://stackoverflow.com/a/68903010/14827069"

2. When executing cpp files with other file inclusions, the configurations in settings.json, is unable to read on the
imported files and thus the command executed on clicking the run button does not give the proper execution command.
    - after every execution i manually added the files name to the command line.

3. Command that is run while clicking the 'Run' button by Code-runner extension can be configured in the settings.json file

4. Unable to update the vscode as it is run as administrator
    - use the winget application to update the same:
    - some useful winget commands are:
        - winget search
            - winget search vscode : will list the applications with the vscode in it and also the id.
            - the id is used in the upgrade command.
        - winget upgrade --id.Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
